# helpdesk

Help desk for school
To run the server, there are different options available.
First, you can open your command prompt by searching for command prompt or cmd in your window's search bar. open your cmd and navigate to the product folder by using the cd command. when in the project folder(which is helpdesk) in our case, issue the following command
"python manage.py runserver". Note the quotes are to be excluded.

another way to run the server is to open the project folder using pycharm or vs_code, find the terminal tab in any of the app listed, open it and issue to following command without the quotes "python manage.py runserver".

head onto your browser at "localhost:8000" or "172.0.0.1:8000" to view your webpages. Do not forget to remove the quotes.
Finally for smooth running and displaying of the web pages, you need to run the project for once with internet connection to enable fetch all the javascript files needed for some of the functionalities to work.
